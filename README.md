### Inspiration
This game was inspired by two seperate game. These were PacMan and Amnesia. I have always played PacMan since a young age and I thought it would be fancy if I was able to spice up the old game a little and I thought that making it have an elelment of horror would be a great idea! This is the outcome of this idea! I hope you enjoy.
