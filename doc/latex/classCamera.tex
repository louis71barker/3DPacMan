\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000004}{Todo}]
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Move the collision workings into the player class.
\item Get collisions to work so the player is able to slide along all surfaces rather then the grabbing method.
\item Make it so that when the mouse pointer hits the screen bourdary, it resets to allow for the camera to rotate freely

cameraUpdate -\/ This is the function that is called within the main which is used to apply the update to the camera each frame. It also tests to see if the player is set before it allows the player to be able to move 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[{\em m\_\-matrix}]-\/ This is passed in so that the player is able to spawn in the correct locations that is allocated in the map matrix \item[{\em m\_\-x}]-\/ This is the value that is passed in from the main which hold the current x position of the mouse on the screen. This is what is used to calculate the rotation needed for the camera \item[{\em m\_\-y}]-\/ This is the value that is passed in from the main which holds the current y position of the mouse pointer on the screen. This is what is used to calculate the rotation needed for the camera to work. \end{DoxyParams}

strafeLeft is a bool that is used to state that the 'a' key is pressed so the player needs to be moveing left. strafeRight is a bool that is used to say state the 'd' key is pressed to indecate that the player needs to move right.

moveForward is a bool that is used to state that the 'w' key is pressed so the player needs to move forward.

moveBackward is a bool that is used to state that the 's' key is pressed so the player needs to move backwards. \hypertarget{classCamera_ab2c726172275816059ddb628f9a20de4}{
