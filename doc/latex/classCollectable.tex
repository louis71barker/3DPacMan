drawCollectable -\/ This is the function that is called in the main to draw both types of collectibles on the screen through the displayList. It is also used to call for collision detection for the collectibles so they are able to be picked up accordingly. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[{\em m\_\-matrix}]-\/ This is the map matrix that is passed in so the collectables are able to be placed where they are allocated on the map \item[{\em \_\-playerx}]-\/ This is the player x position that is passed into the collision detection so that they are able to detect when they have been picked up \item[{\em \_\-playery}]-\/ This is the player z position that is passed into the collision detection so that they are able to detect when they have been picked up \end{DoxyParams}
